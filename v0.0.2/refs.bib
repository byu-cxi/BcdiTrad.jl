abstract = {Iterative projection algorithms are successfully being used as a substitute of lenses to recombine, numerically rather than optically, light scattered by illuminated objects. Images obtained computationally allow aberration-free diffraction-limited imaging and the possibility of using radiation for which no lenses exist. The challenge of this imaging technique is transferred from the lenses to the algorithms. We evaluate these new computational “instruments” developed for the phase-retrieval problem, and discuss acceleration strategies.},

@article{Marchesini2003a,
abstract = {A solution to the inversion problem of scattering would offer aberration-free diffraction-limited three-dimensional images without the resolution and depth-of-field limitations of lens-based tomographic systems. Powerful algorithms are increasingly being used to act as lenses to form such images. Current image reconstruction methods, however, require the knowledge of the shape of the object and the low spatial frequencies unavoidably lost in experiments. Diffractive imaging has thus previously been used to increase the resolution of images obtained by other means. Here we experimentally demonstrate an inversion method, which reconstructs the image of the object without the need for any such prior knowledge.},
